          <p>
            We want to help you build beautiful, accessible, fast, and secure
            websites that work cross-browser, and for all of your users. This
            site is our home for content to help you on that journey, written by
            members of the Chrome team, and external experts.

            Explore our archive of content, covering subjects across the web
            development stack. Find the latest news and content on our blog, and
            discover content by groups on the explore page.

            For complete courses on key web development topics, check out Learn.
            Developed by industry experts, these courses take you right through
            a subject. They are structured to allow you to just dip into one or
            two modules of interest too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Want some grab and go code? Our Patterns break down common web
            development requirements. Whether you want to understand how to
            approach a certain UI component, or need to know how to copy an
            image to the clipboard, you’ll find a solution there.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help you make a case for work on UI or Performance, we have case
            studies. Find out how other companies have used metrics such as Core
            Web Vitals to see real results. And, if that’s quite enough reading
            for one day we also have a great archive of podcasts and other
            shows, plus recordings of our Twitter Space sessions with members of
            the Chrome team.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that a web with multiple browser engines is important,
            and that web sites and applications should work well no matter which
            browser your visitors use. We know that you care about that too, and
            so content on this site should have cross-browser status clearly
            explained. You’ll see that many articles have a component showing
            browser support—the data comes from our friends at MDN, via the
            Browser Compat Data project that powers the data on MDN pages.
